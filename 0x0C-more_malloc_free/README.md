Dynamic Memory Allocation in C: malloc and free

Dynamic memory allocation in C is a powerful feature that allows programs to allocate memory at runtime, rather than being limited to a fixed, compile-time allocation. This is particularly useful when dealing with data structures of unknown or changing size.

The malloc function is the cornerstone of dynamic memory allocation. It stands for 'memory allocation' and is used to request a block of memory of a specified size from the heap. For instance, malloc(sizeof(int)) allocates enough memory to hold an integer.

One crucial point to remember is that malloc does not initialize the memory it allocates. It might contain arbitrary values from previous use. Therefore, it's the programmer's responsibility to properly initialize the memory after allocation.

When you're done using dynamically allocated memory, it's imperative to free it using the free function. Failing to do so can lead to memory leaks, where allocated memory is not properly deallocated. This can cause a program to consume more and more memory over time.
